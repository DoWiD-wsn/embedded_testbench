# Embedded Testbench (ETB)

The **E**mbedded **T**est**b**ench (**ETB**) is platform consisting of a Raspberry Pi add-on and a Python library designed to enable to testing, analyzing, and profiling of embedded systems.
A focus is laid on low-power embedded systems such as wireless sensor nodes.
Additionally, the ETB supports test automation with the possibility of remote control via TCP/IP.
